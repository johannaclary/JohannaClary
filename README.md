## 👋 Hi, I’m Johanna

I’m a GTM leader working at the intersection of AI, SaaS, and developer-facing products.

I work closely with engineers and product teams to:
- translate complex AI capabilities into real customer value
- design sales, onboarding, adoption, and expansion workflows
- prototype and test ideas using AI-first tooling

### How I use GitHub
This space is for lightweight experiments, learning, and prototyping — not production code.

Typical use cases:
- exploring APIs and developer workflows
- testing AI / LLM-driven automations
- small scripts or notebooks to support GTM, CS, or customer enablement
- experimenting with no-code + code hybrids

### Tech I’m comfortable working around
- AI APIs & developer platforms
- LLM-based workflows (prompting, evaluation, automation)
- Python (applied with AI assistance)
- SaaS tooling, data flows, and integrations

I care about building AI products that are usable, reliable, and create real impact for customers.
